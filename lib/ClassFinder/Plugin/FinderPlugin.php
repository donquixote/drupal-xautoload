   * E.g.:
   *   - The class we look for is Some\Namespace\Some\Class
   *   - The file is actually in "exotic/location.php". This is not following
   *     PSR-0 or PEAR standard, so we need a plugin.

   *     because all those exotic classes all begin with Some\Namespace\

   *     ($api = the API object, see below)
   *     $path_fragment = "Some/Namespace/"
   *     $path_suffix = "Some/Class.php"
   *     $api->getClass() gives the original class name, if we still need it.

   *     if ($api->suggestFile('exotic/location.php')) {
   *       return TRUE;
   *     }
   *
   * @param InjectedApiInterface $api
   *   An object with a suggestFile() method.
   *   We are supposed to suggest files until suggestFile() returns TRUE, or we
   *   have no more suggestions.
   * @param string $path_fragment
   *   The key that this plugin was registered with.
   *   With trailing DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.
   * @param string $path_suffix
   *   Second part of the canonical path, ending with '.php'.
   * @param int|string $id
   *   Id under which the plugin was registered.
   *   This may be a numeric id, or a string key.
   *
   * @return bool|NULL
   *   TRUE, if the file was found.
   *   FALSE, otherwise.
